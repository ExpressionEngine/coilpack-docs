# GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and can provide some nice benefits over a traditional REST API.  Sometimes you only need to access a few fields and in that situation it would be very wasteful to pull an entire dataset.  A query in GraphQL lets you specify the pieces of data that you want which greatly reduces the time and bandwidth consumed during a request.

## Tools

You can interact with your site's GraphQL endpoints by using the built-in GraphiQL tool at `/graphiql`.

Alternatively we recommend using [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to test your queries.
