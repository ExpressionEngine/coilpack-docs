# Templates

A big part of why Coilpack was created is to allow you to express your content through multiple templating engines. We currently support two powerful and popular options: [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/)
and [Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/blade#introduction).

The following is a brief overview of the available template languages to help you decide which language might suit you best.

**Blade** is a great option if you are familiar with the PHP language.  It offers some nice syntactical improvements over plain PHP while keeping the power and control.

**Twig** provides a great layer of abstraction over plain PHP while providing familiar control structures and a filter system to accomplish most things possible in raw PHP.

**ExpressionEngine Native** template language is a simplified syntax designed to be easily understood by someone unfamiliar with PHP or programming languages in general.

## Twig and Blade in ExpressionEngine

In ExpressionEngine 7.2.3+ you can create a regular template file and add the suffix `.twig` or `.blade` to the file.
This will tell ExpressionEngine which template engine should be used to render your content.

For example you might want to create a `blog` listing that is rendered with Twig.
You would do this by creating a file at `user/templates/blog.group/index.html.twig`.

[Learn more about using Twig in ExpressionEngine from our guide](../guides/using-twig-templates.md).

## Twig and Blade in Laravel

If you manage your templates inside your Laravel application you will just need to create files in your `resources/views` folder with either a `.twig` or a `.blade.php` extension and include them with the `view()` helper.  The Laravel documentation is a great resource for [learning more about views](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/views#introduction).

## Using ExpressionEngine Tags

Coilpack aims to maintain a familiar syntax with native ExpressionEngine templates in both Twig and Blade.  Here is a simple example of how a module tag would be rendered in each of the available template engines.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="native" label="Native">

```php
{exp:module_name:tag_name parameter_1="value_1"}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="twig" label="Twig">

```twig
{{ exp.module_name.tag_name({parameter_1: 'value_1'}) }}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="blade" label="Blade">

```php
{{ $exp->module_name->tag_name(['parameter_1' => 'value_1']) }}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Channel Entries

In ExpressionEngine much of our content is retrieved through the Channel Entries Tag which is a tag pair that would be used like this in a template:


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="native" label="Native">

```php
{exp:channel:entries channel="blog"}
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <div>
        {page_content}
    </div>
    {if no_results}
        <span>No blog entries</span>
    {/if}
{/exp:channel:entries}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="twig" label="Twig">

```twig
{% for entry in exp.channel.entries({channel: 'blog'}) %}
    <h1>{{ entry.title }}</h1>
    <div>
        {{ entry.page_content }}
    </div>
{% else %}
    <span>No blog entries</span>
{% endfor %}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="blade" label="Blade">

```php
@forelse($exp->channel->entries(['channel' => 'blog']) as $entry)
    <h1>{{ $entry->title }}</h1>
    <div>
        {{ $entry->page_content }}
    </div>
@empty
    <span>No blog entries</span>
@endforelse
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Referencing other templates from inside Twig and Blade

Both and Twig and Blade provide methods for including other template files.  When you do this with files inside your `user/templates` folder you will need to include the `ee::` namespace in the path.  For instance if we want to include a partial inside a Twig view we would write `{% include('ee::folder._partial') %}`

## Global Variables

All of the regular ExpressionEngine global variables are available to you inside Twig and Blade views.  A few small adjustments are necessary though to work with the new templating engines.  Here is an example of how global variables are prefixed and are accessed differently in Twig and Blade:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="native" label="Native">

```php
{structure:parent:id}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="twig" label="Twig">

```twig
{{ global.structure.parent.id }}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="blade" label="Blade">

```php
{{ $global->structure->parent->id }}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Example Usage

We have provided the default ExpressionEngine theme converted into Twig and Blade as a point of reference.  You can view these files in your `vendor/expressionengine/coilpack/resources/views` folder.
