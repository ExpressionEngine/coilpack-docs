# Email Contact Form

exp.email.contact_form
```

## Parameters

### Return

exp.email.contact_form({return: 'email/thanks'})
```

With this parameter, you can specify the css class you want the form to have, enabling fine-grained styling of the form.

```php
exp.email.contact_form({form_class: 'contact-form'})
```

### Form ID

With this parameter, you can specify the css id you want the form to have. The default value is ‘contact_form’.


```php
exp.email.contact_form({form_id: 'contact_form'})
```
