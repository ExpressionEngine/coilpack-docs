# Comment Entries

The Comment Entries Tag enables you to show the user-submitted comments associated with your entries.

:::note
Coilpack provides a slightly different experience for the comment entries tag when used in a Twig, Blade or GraphQL context.  Pagination is handled differently and some parameters may behave differently. See the ExpressionEngine Documentation for additional information on the [Comment Entries Tag](https://docs.expressionengine.com/latest/comment/entries.html)
:::

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="native" label="Native">

```php
{exp:comment:entries}
    {comment}
{/exp:comment:entries}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="twig" label="Twig">

```twig
{% for entry in exp.comment.entries %}
    {{ entry.comment }}
{% endfor %}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="blade" label="Blade">

```php
@foreach($exp->comment->entries as $entry)
    {{ $entry->comment }}
@endforeach
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```graphql
{
    exp_comment_entries {
        data {
            comment
        }
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Parameters

The examples below are how the Comment Entries tag would look using every parameter.  Please note that this is only for illustration purposes as some of these parameters would never be used together to achieve a meaningful result.

<Tabs groupId="templating-engines">
<TabItem value="native" label="Native">

```php
{exp:comment:entries
    author_id="5"
    channel="channel1|channel2"

<TabItem value="blade" label="Blade">

    "author_id" => "5",
    "channel" => "channel1|channel2",
    "comment_id" => "22",
    "dynamic" => true,

    "url_title" => "my_wedding"
]) as $entry)
    {{ $entry->comment }}
@endforeach
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="GraphQL">

```graphql
{
    exp_comment_entries(
        author_id: "5",
        channel: "channel1|channel2",
        comment_id: "22",
        dynamic: true,
        entry_id: "not 45|534|807",

        limit: "30",
        orderby: "date",
        site: "1",
        sort: "asc",
        status: "Closed",
        url_title: "my_wedding"
    ) {
        comment
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Author ID

The `author_id` parameter will limit the returned entries to the specified Member ID

```php
author_id: 3
```

### Channel

Choose which channel to show the entries (will show all channels if no channel is specified).

```php
channel: "blog"
```

Additionally, you can use the pipe character to separate multiple channels:

```php
channel: "channel1|channel2|channel3"
```

Or you can add the word "not" (with a space after it) to exclude channels:

```php
channel: "not channel1|channel2|channel3"
```

### Comment ID

You can hard code the comment entries tag to show specific comments. As with the `entry_id`` parameter, you may also specify multiple comments by separating them with the pipe character.

```php
comment_id: "22"
```

### Dynamic

When enabled the channel entries tag will select an entry dynamically based on what is in the URL.  The native ExpressionEngine Channel Entries tag has `dynamic=true` by default, however Coilpack operates differently and uses `dynamic: false` as a default.

If you want to list entries in a "sidebar" on your site and have them always be the same ones regardless of which page on your site you visit (main page, archives, comments, etc.) then you will want to use the default `dynamic: false` parameter.

```php
dynamic: true
```

### Entry ID

You can hard code the channel tag to show a specific channel entry.

```php
entry_id: "147"
```

You may also specify multiple entries by separating them with the pipe character:

```php
entry_id: "13|42|147"
```

Or use "not" to exclude entries::

```php
entry_id: "not 45|534|807"
```

### Entry Status

Restrict comments to those belonging to entries with a specified status.

```php
entry_status: "Featured"
```

### Limit

This parameter limits the number of entries on any given page. The limit will default to all entries if a value is not specified.

```php
limit: 5
```

### Orderby

The orderby parameter sets the display order of the entries.

```php
orderby: "title"
```

### Site

The `site` parameter restricts the entries to your specified `site_id`.

```php
site: "1"
```

### Sort

The sort order can be ascending or descending. The order will default to “descending” if nothing is specified.

### Status

Restrict to entries with a particular status

```php
status: "Closed"
```

### URL Title

This parameter limits the query by an entry’s url_title. You can use the pipe character to query by multiple url_titles:

```php
url_title: "my_wedding|my_honeymoon|my_kids"
```

Or you can add "not" to exclude url_titles:

```php
url_title: "not my_in_laws"
```
